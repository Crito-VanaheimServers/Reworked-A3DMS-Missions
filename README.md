# Reworked-A3DMS-Missions
Credit for A3DMS Missions goes Defent and eraser1. Credit for Ned missions with difficulty system goes to [CiC]red_ned. I reworked This version of a3dms missions has reinforcements for both bandit and static missions. You will need to run these missions and scripts for all of this to work because I had to work some code over in 2 mission monitor scripts for bandit missions to get the reinforcements to work and rework code in every bandit mission to get them to work off the new script versions. Take a look inside mission folder, bandit folder, and open blackHawkDown to see a completly reworked mission with a few details on new things added. also there are reworked static missions as well so take a look at Chelonisi Power, Saltflats, and Stop the Mayor missions.
